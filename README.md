# My Personal Project

## An online quiz system

## Introduction

Students at UBC are very passionate about practising the exam materials before /
prior to the exam. Usually, they would use past midterms or past finals from their
instructor to practise. However, not all instructors will release past exams, so students
don't know where to practise. They thought about redoing all their past assignments, worksheets,
and tutorials, but it doesn't give the same feeling as attempting an exam because they have
done those tasks beforehand and they are simply redoing it. So they try answer other people's
confusions on Piazza. Think about it, what if there was a way to make Piazza, but for **quizzes** instead of questions?

## Overview

**"There is no better way to learn than to teach"** -Robert Oppenheimer \
... or than to *test*.
This online quiz system will allow students to make custom quizzes based on the material which will be for other students
to practise. Other students will be able to go through these quizzes under exam settings. By creating quizzes like this, it is
guaranteed to enforce student learning, because a higher level of understanding is required to create well-worded problems, and
be prepared to explain the solutions later on. This will create greater levels of insight for all other students as well, and hopefully,
just hopefully, ...increase the *average* for many classes.



## Goal

What this project will *do*:
- Students can **create** a quiz for other students to attempt
- Questions can be of a number answer format, a multiple choice format, or an essay format
- Setting the questions in *three different formats* will allow flexiblity from courses like CPSC, CHEM, MATH, to even ENGL
- There will be a great variety of quizzes since all students are given the option to create quizzes.
- Students will be able to star another student's quiz.
- (ADDITIONAL) Add an instructor panel, which may give feedback on student's self-made exams, and 

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.
